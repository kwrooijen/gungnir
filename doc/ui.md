# UI

Gungnir's Models and Changesets can be used in Clojurescript as well. The goal
is to be able to write validations in one place. Being able to use them in both
Clojure and Clojurescript, without the need for websockets.

Gungnir provides a separate project,
[gungnir.ui](https://github.com/kwrooijen/gungnir.ui). This can be added
separately for validating the frontend.

* [form](https://kwrooijen.github.io/gungnir/form.html) - Establishing a
  database connection, thread pooling, and handling database errors.
